# bt3-file-dump-organizer
A means of organizing dumped content (with AFS Explorer) from DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3's AFS files into four folders (six, if you count the original AFS folders provided by the user):
* Characters
* Maps
* Menus
* Scenarios

Even though the tool supports BT3 AFS files of any region, it is far from perfect, and works best for ``PZS3US1.AFS`` and ``PZS3US2.AFS``.
